You may wish to go into /home/vagrant/.npmrc and reset the values to match your own.

Here is where they are currently set (which is why you want to change them)
init-author-name=Pete Carapetyan
init-author-email=pete@datafundamentals.com
init-author-url=http://datafundamentals.com
init-license=MIT

nvm will not run until you initialize it for that session of bash
This is due to the inability of Pete Carapetyan, the author of the vm, to understand how bash works.
TO CORRECT THIS run '. /etc/profile.d/enable_nvm.sh' or 'source /etc/profile.d/enable_nvm.sh' and it will solve the problem, but only in that shell
